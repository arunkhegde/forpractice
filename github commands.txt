git branch:
    check branches
    git branch -D <name of branch> :Delete branch
git checkout:
    git checkout -b <name of branch> :create a branch and go there
    git checkout <name of branch>:go to that branch 


create branch commit
then merge to master.

git merge <branch name>:

note:
if we push branch we will get error because github doesnt know we have a branch.
So git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>.
